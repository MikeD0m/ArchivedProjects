Yeaah
Let me speak
 
As I take this time of solitude to reflect,
I feel that with my parents *pause* I'm in debt,
I feel like living in Poverty was a test
To see if I could progress
To see if I would ever taste success

From myself I expected nothing less,
Played my cards right until there was nothing left
and well you know the rest

To others, thats not what they would expect,
Through my actions,*Pause* I contest
Through my words, *Pause* I protest
Look at my work, I attest

It was hard I confess
So much work I was stressed
Got so much worse, I need rest
But, my engine I had to rev

So whos to tell me I aint the best
